# Spin Table:

Included in `AtomicMassEvaluation` lies a tabulated spin table for
each nuclei, updated up to 2020, and published here:

Chinese Physics C, 45(3), 030001. (2021) doi:10.1088/1674-1137/abddae 

# Binding Energy Tables

Included here are tables of binding energy per nucleon in MeV for
nuclides specified by (N, Z).

The data for these tables is derived from the Atomic Mass Evaluations
2012 and 2016. By default, pynucastro uses Atomic Mass Evaluation
2016. Scripts for reading the Atomic Mass Evaluation tables,
citations, and links for the tables are provided in the
`AtomicMassEvaluation` directory.

# Partition Functions

The script `convert_rathpf_2000.py` converts the files `part_etfsiq.asc.txt` 
and `part_frdm.asc.txt` to a convinient format to an standard pynucastro 
format. The table `part_frdm.asc.txt` is depicted in:

T. Rauscher and F.-K.Thielemann, ADNDT 75 (2000) 1.

and computed by using the finite range droplet model (FRDM model). This model 
is described in detail here:

Data Tabl. 59, 185 (1995), doi:10.1006/adnd.1995.1002

The table `part_etfsiq.asc.txt` was not mentioned in the previous article, but 
the authors included their computed partition function values by using the 
Thomas-Fermi approach with Strutinski integral (ETFSI-Q), described here:

J. M. Pearson, R. C. Nayak, and S. Goriely, Phys. Lett. B 387, 455 (1996).

The script `convert_rathpf_2003.py` converts the `datafile2.txt` and `datafile3.txt` 
partition function table files into a pynucastro standard. The files datafile2.txt 
and datafile3.txt are the computed partition values from the FRDM and ETFSI-Q 
models for higher temperatures, respectively. The details of these 
calculations are exposed here:

T. Rauscher, Ap. J. Suppl. 147 (2003) 403

All the previous scripts and data files are located in the `PartitionFunction` 
directory.
