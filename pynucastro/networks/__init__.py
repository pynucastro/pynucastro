"""The pynucastro modules that support the creation of networks.
There are several main submodules here:

:meth:`amrexastro_cxx_network <pynucastro.networks.amrexastro_cxx_network>`:
the support routines to generate a C++ network that can be incorporated
into the AMReX-Astro Microphysics routines supported by astrophysical
hydrodynamics codes.

:meth:`base_cxx_network <pynucastro.networks.base_cxx_network>`:
the support routines to generate a standalone integrable network in
pure C++.

:meth:`fortran_network <pynucastro.networks.fortran_network>`: the
support routines for creating Fortran wrappers around the simple C++
network.

:meth:`nse_network <pynucastro.networks.nse_network>`: a network
specialized in solving for nuclear statistical equilibrium.

:meth:`numpy_network <pynucastro.networks.numpy_network>`: a network
that caches rates to allow for more efficient computation.

:meth:`python_network <pynucastro.networks.python_network>`: the
support routines to generate a full, integrable network in python.

:meth:`rate_collection <pynucastro.networks.rate_collection>`: this is
simply a collection of rates that knows about the links connecting
nuclei.  This is used as the base for the different classes the write
code to output networks for integration.

:meth:`simple_cxx_network <pynucastro.networks.simple_cxx_network>`:
the support routines to generate a simple pure C++ network for
interfacing with simulation codes.

:meth:`sympy_network_support <pynucastro.networks.sympy_network_support>`:
common set of sympy routines that are used for code generation from
networks.
