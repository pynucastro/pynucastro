These tabulated reaction rates are included along with library files
describing how the tables should be read.

Tabulated reactions of the form `A -> B` are supported, where the
rates are tabulated in a two-dimensional space of:

- the product of density and electron fraction
- temperature

This directory includes tabulated rates as followed:
