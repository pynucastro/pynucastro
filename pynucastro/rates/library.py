                3. a single reactant Nucleus
                4. a single string description of the reactant nuclide
            products  -- Description of the products in same form as above
            exact     -- boolean,
                         if True, products or reactants must match exactly [default]
                         if False, then all products or reactants must be found
                         in a comparison rate, but the comparison may contain
                         additional products or reactants
            reverse   -- boolean,
                         if True, only match reverse-derived rates
                         if False, only match directly-derived rates
                         if None, you don't care, match both [default]
            min_reactants -- int, match Rates that have at least this many reactants
            min_products  -- int, match Rates that have at least this many products
            max_reactants -- int, match Rates that have no more than this many reactants
            max_products  -- int, match Rates that have no more than this many products
            filter_function -- callable (Rate -> bool),
                               a callable that can take a single rate as an argument
                               may be used to specify additional criteria, returning
                               True if the rate meets all of them, False otherwise

        Examples:
            Create a filter that finds all proton capture and proton-burning reactions
            in a Library instance my_library::
                >>> pcap_filter = RateFilter(reactants='p', exact=False)
                >>> pcap_library = my_library.filter(pcap_filter)
            or you can use Nucleus::
                >>> pcap_filter = RateFilter(reactants=Nucleus('p'), exact=False)
                >>> pcap_library = my_library.filter(pcap_filter)

            Create a filter that finds C12 (a,g) O16
            Notes:
                + photons/gammas are not treated as nuclides, so they cannot be
                a reactant or product
                + this rate is in the ReacLib library used here as
                O16 --> He4 C12 -- you need to know how your library treats rates::
                    >>> cago_filter = RateFilter(reactants='o16', products=['c12', 'a'])
                    >>> cago_library = my_library.filter(cago_filter)
