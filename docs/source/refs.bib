Our flame model builds on the advection-diffusion-reaction model of Khokhlov and includes electron screening and Coulomb corrections to the equation of state in a self-consistent way. We calibrate this model flame—its energetics and timescales for energy release and neutronization—with self-heating reaction network calculations that include both these Coulomb effects and up-to-date weak interactions. The burned material evolves postflame due to both weak interactions and hydrodynamic changes in density and temperature. We develop a scheme to follow the evolution, including neutronization, of the NSE state subsequent to the passage of the flame front. As a result, our model flame is suitable for deflagration simulations over a wide range of initial central densities and can track the temperature and electron fraction of the burned material through the explosion and into the expansion of the ejecta.}

abstract = {Electron-capture and β-decay rates for nuclear pairs in the sd-shell are evaluated at high densities and high temperatures relevant to the final evolution of electron-degenerate O–Ne–Mg cores of stars with initial masses of 8–10 M⊙. Electron capture induces a rapid contraction of the electron-degenerate O–Ne–Mg core. The outcome of rapid contraction depends on the evolutionary changes in the central density and temperature, which are determined by the competing processes of contraction, cooling, and heating. The fate of the stars is determined by these competitions, whether they end up with electron-capture supernovae or Fe core-collapse supernovae. Since the competing processes are induced by electron capture and β-decay, the accurate weak rates are crucially important. The rates are obtained for pairs with A = 20, 23, 24, 25, and 27 by shell-model calculations in the sd-shell with the USDB Hamiltonian. Effects of Coulomb corrections on the rates are evaluated. The rates for pairs with A = 23 and 25 are important for nuclear Urca processes that determine the cooling rate of the O–Ne–Mg core, while those for pairs with A = 20 and 24 are important for the core contraction and heat generation rates in the core. We provide these nuclear rates at stellar environments in tables with fine enough meshes at various densities and temperatures for studies of astrophysical processes sensitive to the rates. In particular, the accurate rate tables are crucially important for the final fates of not only O–Ne–Mg cores but also a wider range of stars, such as C–O cores of lower-mass stars.}

abstract = {Production rates obtained from a detailed chemical mechanism are analyzed in order to quantify the coupling between the various species and reactions involved. These interactions can be represented by a directed relation graph. A geometric error propagation strategy applied to this graph accurately identifies the dependencies of specified targets and creates a set of increasingly simplified kinetic schemes containing only the chemical paths deemed the most important for the targets. An integrity check is performed concurrently with the reduction process to avoid truncated chemical paths and mass accumulation in intermediate species. The quality of a given skeletal model is assessed through the magnitude of the errors introduced in the target predictions. The applied error evaluation is variable-dependent and unambiguous for unsteady problems. The technique yields overall monotonically increasing errors, and the smallest skeletal mechanism that satisfies a user-defined error tolerance over a selected domain of applicability is readily obtained. An additional module based on life-time analysis identifies a set of species that can be modeled accurately by quasi-steady state relations. An application of the reduction procedure is presented for autoignition using a large iso-octane mechanism. The whole process is automatic, is fast, has moderate CPU and memory requirements, and compares favorably to other existing techniques.}

By using each algorithm with DRGEP to produce skeletal mechanisms from a detailed mechanism for n-heptane with randomly-shuffled species order, it is demonstrated that only Dijkstra’s algorithm and RBFS produce results independent of species order. In addition, each algorithm is used with DRGEP to generate skeletal mechanisms for n-heptane covering a comprehensive range of autoignition conditions for pressure, temperature, and equivalence ratio. Dijkstra’s algorithm combined with a coefficient scaling approach is demonstrated to produce the most compact skeletal mechanism with a similar performance compared to larger skeletal mechanisms resulting from the other algorithms. The computational efficiency of each algorithm is also compared by applying the DRGEP method with each search algorithm on the large detailed mechanism for n-alkanes covering n-octane to n-hexadecane with 2115 species and 8157 reactions. Dijkstra’s algorithm implemented with a binary heap priority queue is demonstrated as the most efficient method, with a CPU cost two orders of magnitude less than the other search algorithms.}

abstract = {The weak interaction rates in stellar matter are calculated for the sd-shell nuclei in the full-shell model configurations using the effective interaction of Wildenthal, taking into account the recent extensive compilations of experimental energy levels and Gamow-Teller β decay rates. Based on comparisons between the present calculation and that of Fuller, Fowler, and Newman (FFN), it is pointed out that correct treatment of nuclear structure effects is decisive in attaining reliable weak interaction rates in stellar matter. The weak rates are tabulated at the same grid points of density and temperature as those of FFN, for the ranges 10 ≤ ρYe (g·cm−3) ≤ 1011 and 0.01 × 109 ≤ T (K) ≤ 30 × 109.}

title = {Estimates of Stellar Weak Interaction Rates for Nuclei in the Mass
Range A = 65-80},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
abstract = {We estimate lepton capture and emission rates, as well as
                  neutrino energy loss rates, for nuclei in the mass
                  range A = 65-80. These rates are calculated on a
                  temperature/density grid appropriate for a wide
                  range of astrophysical applications including
                  simulations of late time stellar evolution and X-ray
                  bursts. The basic inputs in our single-particle and
                  empirically inspired model are (i) experimentally
                  measured level information, weak transition matrix
                  elements, and lifetimes, (ii) estimates of matrix
                  elements for allowed experimentally unmeasured
                  transitions based on the systematics of
                  experimentally observed allowed transitions, and
                  (iii) estimates of the centroids of the GT
                  resonances motivated by shell model calculations in
                  the fp shell as well as by (n, p) and (p, n)
                  experiments. Fermi resonances (isobaric analog
                  states) are also included, and it is shown that
                  Fermi transitions dominate the rates for most
                  interesting proton-rich nuclei for which an
                  experimentally determined ground state lifetime is
                  unavailable. For the purposes of comparing our
                  results with more detailed shell model based
                  calculations we also calculate weak rates for nuclei
                  in the mass range A = 60-65 for which Langanke &amp;
                  Martinez-Pinedo have provided rates. The typical
                  deviation in the electron capture and β-decay rates
                  for these ≈30 nuclei is less than a factor of 2 or 3
                  for a wide range of temperature and density
                  appropriate for presupernova stellar evolution. We
                  also discuss some subtleties associated with the
                  partition functions used in calculations of stellar
                  weak rates and show that the proper treatment of the
                  partition functions is essential for estimating
                  high-temperature β-decay rates. In particular, we
                  show that partition functions based on unconverged
                  Lanczos calculations can result in errors in
                  estimates of high-temperature β-decay rates.}
