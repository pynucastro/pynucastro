Overview of pynucastro
======================

pynucastro is a set of python interfaces to nuclear reaction rates. It
is meant for both interactive exploration of rates (through Jupyter
notebooks) and to create reaction networks for use in simulation
codes.

The preferred way of importing pynucastro is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   import pynucastro as pyna


The main classes are:

* :func:`Nucleus <pynucastro.rates.rate.Nucleus>`: This is a single
  nucleus.  It knows its proton number, Z, neutron number, N, and
  weight, A.

* :func:`Rate <pynucastro.rates.rate.Rate>`: This is a single rate.  It
  knows the reactants and products and has methods that allow you to
  evaluate it at a specified temperature and plot its temperature
  dependence.

* :func:`Library <pynucastro.rates.rate.Library>`: This is a collection of
  rates (for example, the entire ReacLib library).  It provides methods
  for filtering out rates based on different sets of rules.

* :func:`Composition
  <pynucastro.networks.rate_collection.Composition>`: This is a
  collection of nuclei and their mass fractions.  A ``Composition`` is
  used when evaluating the full rates in a network.

* :func:`RateCollection
  <pynucastro.networks.rate_collection.RateCollection>`: This is the
  most basic form of a network.  It is a collection of rates and
  nuclei, that knows about the connectivity of the nuclei through
  different reactions.  This acts as the base class for different
  reaction networks.  A ``RateCollection`` has methods to evaluate the
  rates and make a plot of the links between rates.

* :func:`PythonNetwork
  <pynucastro.networks.python_network.PythonNetwork>`: This is a
  collection of rates with functions that know how to write python
  code to express the righthand side of the system of ODEs.

Usage
-----

There are two modes of usage for pynucastro.  

* Within a Jupyter notebook, one can evaluate the rates and
  interactively visualize a network and see the flow between nuclei as
  connections colored by the rate linking them.

* You can use pynucastro to write the righthand side routine for the
  system of ODEs that must be integrated to evolve a reaction network.
  A reaction network takes the form:

  .. math::

     \frac{dY_i}{dt} = - \sum_{j,k} Y_i Y_j \lambda_{i(j,k)l} + \sum_{j,k} Y_l Y_k \lambda_{l(j,k)i}

  where the :math:`\lambda`'s are the rates of destruction and creation
  of species i, represented by the molar fraction :math:`Y_i` (see,
  e.g., `Timmes 1999
  <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJS..124..241T>`_).  pynucastro
  will create the righthand sides of this system of ODEs (as python or
  Fortran code) from the list of rates you provide. One can use this to
  add reaction networks to existing simulation codes, for example, the
  `MAESTROeX <https://amrex-astro.github.io/MAESTROeX/>`_ and `Castro
  <https://amrex-astro.github.io/Castro/>`_ codes.


Data sources
------------

pynucastro can currently read rates from:

* `JINA Reaclib <https://reaclib.jinaweb.org/>`_

* Electron-capture / :math:`\beta`-decay rates from Suzuki et al. 2016
