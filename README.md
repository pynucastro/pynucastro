pynucastro is a python library for nuclear astrophysics.  It provides
access to nuclear data and reaction rates, and tools for building
and interactively nuclear reaction networks.

The main features are:

  * Easy access to nuclear properties, including T-dependent partition
    functions, spins, masses, etc.

  * The ability to create a reaction network based on a collection of
    rates, a set of nuclei, or an arbitrary filter applied to a
    library.

    * Includes support for ReacLib rates and tabulated weak rates from
      a variety of sources.

  * Interactive exploration of rates and networks in Jupyter
    notebooks, including:

    * Many different ways of visualizing a network.

    * The ability to export a NetworkX graph (for instance, to find
      cycles).

  * Methods to determine which rates are important and which might be
    missing from a network, as well as analyze the stiffness of a
    network.

  * The ability to approximate rates and derive reverse rates via
    detailed balance.

  * An NSE solver to find the equilibrium abundance of a set of nuclei
    given a thermodynamic state.

  * The ability to write out python or C++ code needed to integrate
    the network.

  * Additional physic methods for thermal neutrino sources and
    Fermi-Dirac integrals.

## Examples

### Exploring a reaction rate

The following example reads in the ReacLib rate database and
gets the rate for C13(p,g)N14 and evaluates it at a
temperature of 1.e9 K and makes a plot of the T dependence:

```
In [1]: import pynucastro as pyna

In [2]: rl = pyna.ReacLibLibrary()

In [3]: c13pg = rl.get_rate_by_name("c13(p,g)n14")

In [4]: c13pg.eval(1.e9)
Out[4]: 3883.4778216250666

In [5]: fig = c13pg.plot()

In [6]: fig.savefig("c13pg.png")

```

The resulting figure is:

### Creating a network

The following builds a simple network that has carbon burning, outputs
the value of the rates at a set of thermodynamic conditions, and plots
the network:

```
In [1]: import pynucastro as pyna

In [2]: nuclei = ["p", "he4", "c12", "n13", "o16", "ne20", "na23", "mg24"]

In [3]: net = pyna.network_helper(nuclei, use_tabular_rates=False)

modifying Na23 + p ‚ü∂ C12 + C12 from C12 + C12 ‚ü∂ p + Na23
modifying Mg24 + He4 ‚ü∂ C12 + O16 from O16 + C12 ‚ü∂ He4 + Mg24

In [4]: rho = 1.e7

In [5]: T = 3.e9

In [6]: comp = pyna.Composition(nuclei)

In [7]: comp.set_equal()

In [8]: net.evaluate_rates(rho=rho, T=T, composition=comp)

In [9]: fig = net.plot(rotated=True, hide_xalpha=True)

```

After the network is created, we see messages saying that a number
of reverse rates were rederived using detailed balance.

The resulting figure is:

### Interactive exploration

We can also interactively explore a reaction network.  Here's an
example of hot-CNO with breakout reactions:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pynucastro/pynucastro/HEAD?labpath=examples%2Fhot-CNO-breakout-example.ipynb)

by increasing the temperature, you can see the transition from CNO to
hot-CNO (proton captures on C13 become faster than the beta decay) and
then the breakout of hot-CNO when the alpha capture on O14 becomes
faster than its decay.


## Installation

pynucastro is available on PyPI and can be installed via:
```
pip install pynucastro
```

Alternately, to install via source, you can do:
```
pip install .
```
for a systemwide install, or
```
pip install --user .
```
for a single-user install.  This will put the pynucastro modules and library in
the default location python searches for packages.


### Requirements

pynucastro is supported on Python 3.10 or later and the following libraries:

* `numpy`

* `sympy`

* `scipy`

* `matplotlib`

* `networkx`

* `ipywidgets`

* `numba`

To build the documentation or run the unit tests, `sphinx` and
`pytest` are additionally required along with some supporting
packages. See the included `requirements.txt` file for a list of these
packages and versions. To install the packages from the requirements
file, do:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Is important to stress out that all the dependencies should be
installed before `pynucastro`, otherwise the installation should be
repeated.

People who make a number of substantive contributions (new features,
bug fixes, etc.) will be named "core developers" of pynucastro.

Core developers will be recognized in the following ways:

  * invited to the group's slack team

  * listed in the User's Guide and website as a core developer

  * listed in the author list on the Zenodo DOI for the project
    (as given in the .zenodo.json file)
