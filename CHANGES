# changes since the last release

  -- added the ability to modify rate products (#252)

  -- allow for the edges between nodes to be curved (#257)

  -- add a RatePair object that groups forward and reverse rates (#212)

  -- updated the ReacLib rate library (#248)

  -- added nuclear spin tables (#238)

  -- added partition function tables (#241, #204)

  -- a Nucleus no knows its binding energy (#220)

  -- many improvements to C++ output (#246, #214, #185, #183)

  -- added a diff method to a Library (#194)

  -- fixed rate sorting so it is more deterministic (#216)

  -- added forward() and backward() methods to Library (#207)

  -- added a default ReacLibLibrary function (#206)

  -- added a validate() method for a library to find potentially
     important missing rates (#188, #172)

  -- added a method to get the number of rates in a library (#173)

  -- add a method to remove a rate from a library (#199)

  -- libraries are now sorted when printed, with more information
     shown (#195, #168)

  -- added a symmetric screening option (#178)

  -- a "rotated" plot type for the network structure was added (#161)

  -- versioning is now managed by setuptools_scm (#158)

# 1.6.0

  -- added support for C++ StarKiller / AMReX Microphysics networks
     (#152, #151, #149)

  -- centralized sympy code generation and removed common
     subexpression support from network generation (#145)

  -- added an example on integrating a python network

# 1.5.0

  -- Added gridplot function for plotting nuclides on a grid and
     coloring the cells by X, Y, Xdot, Ydot or activity

  -- Created a notebook and a script for generating rp-process
     networks. The script allows an arbitrary endpoint to be
     specified.

  -- Added a filter_function option to RateFilter and to the plotting
     functions that allows for filtering rates or nuclei using a
     user-defined Boolean map.

  -- Fixed a write_network crash if the RateCollection contains
     multiple rates with the same name.

  -- Deleted unused BLAS and VODE files previously used for the
     standalone Fortran outputs. These have been deprecated in favor
     of the StarKiller Microphysics network output as of v1.3.0.

  -- fixed screening for the 3-alpha rate

# 1.4.1

  -- Improvements for locating rate files in directories also
     containing python scripts or Jupyter notebooks

  -- Fixed a warning when using Numba

  -- Updates to the StarKiller Microphysics format for compile time
     variables

  -- Enhancements for the RateCollection Explorer to use NetworkX 2.5

  -- Updated the requirements

# 1.4.0

  -- Added general support for tabulated weak rates from Suzuki, et
     al. 2016

  -- Added a simple pp network example

  -- Updated StarKiller Microphysics output to track latest changes in
     Microphysics network API

  -- Added a core developers policy in the Readme

# 1.3.0

  -- Replace double precision reals in StarKiller networks with custom
     real type `_rt`

  -- Incorporate modifications to thermal neutrino Jacobian
     contributions from Microphysics (#210) in StarKiller networks

  -- Simplify rate evaluation code in StarKiller networks

  -- Deprecated standalone Fortran output with VODE integration.

  -- BaseFortranNetwork is now an abstract class to require users to
     either use StarKillerNetwork or provide templates

# 1.2.0

  -- Fix tabular rate bug where electron chemical potential
     contributions were not included

  -- Update documentation and code comments

  -- Add Numba support for Python networks

  -- Enable sparse Jacobian (CSR) for StarKiller networks

  -- Incorporate CUDA Fortran port for StarKiller networks including
     tabulated rates

  -- Optimize rate screening evaluation for StarKiller networks

  -- Fix bug to include the electron fraction and correct density
     dependence for Reaclib electron capture rates

  -- Allow a nuclide to be both reactant and product

  -- Updates an error message for multiple degenerate rates

  -- Add example code generating a 160-isotope network

  -- Fix table compilation issue for StarKiller networks

  -- Moved energy generation subroutine into RHS module for StarKiller
     networks
