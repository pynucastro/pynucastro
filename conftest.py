"""
Recent versions of numpy use AVX-512 routines from SVML to speed up some math
functions on processors that support it. These implementations allow a maximum
error of 4 ULP, which is looser than in previous versions. Our tests for
write_network() (and probably some others) expect exactly reproducible floating
point values, which may differ between the AVX-512 and fallback
implementations. Unfortunately, not all of Github's runners support AVX-512, so
we get unpredictable CI failures depending on what hardware the tests run on.

For now, we're disabling these features when running the test suite with the
NPY_DISABLE_CPU_FEATURES environment variable. This needs to be set before
numpy is imported for the first time, and will emit a RuntimeWarning if the
disabled features are not supported by the machine.

This may be fixed by https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24006, which uses the
high accuracy (within 1 ULP) SVML routines for float64 values.
